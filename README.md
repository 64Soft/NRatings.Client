### IMPORTANT: if you still have a version prior to v5.0.0 of NRatings installed on your machine, you should probably first uninstall it (via Windows "Add or remove programs") just to be on the safe side...

The deployment is using the Microsoft ClickOnce technology. At every application startup, it should automatically check if a new version is available, and update it automatically if that's the case.
